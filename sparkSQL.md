### B.

6.56 units of unemployment rate

## 5 Cont. of 4

### A. 

Weighted average is 6.15 units of unemployment rate

### B. 

The BLS average is 6.2, suggesting my weighted average is more accurate than my plain average. This is makes sense since the

weighted average accounts for the size of a population, e.g. a population of 10000 is not treated the same as a population of

1 million. 

### 6) Max unemployment rate in Texas with labor force > 10k

54.1 units of unemployment rate (ouch). February, 1990, Rio Grande City, TX

### 7) Max unemployment rate anywhere with labor force > 10k

58.9 units of unemployment rate (ouch again), July, 2013, San Luis City, AZ

### 8) What state has the most distinct data series?

For this, I consider series_id with different measure codes as different series, e.g. 

LASBS060000000000003 is different from LASBS060000000000006

Maine, with 2296 units of distinct series

### 9)

I could not get the scatterPlotGrid to work, and no matter what I tried,

I could not filter out Alaska, Hawaii, or Puerto Rico. 

Rate of 9 is red, 6 is blue, 1 is green, across a gradient
