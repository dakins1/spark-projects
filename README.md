This repo contains my various projects I completed in Trinity University's Big Data computer science course. I have numerous markdown files that summarize my findings from each project. **I recommend seeing the final-writeup.md file**, as this was the writeup for our semester final project. For this project I picked the dataset and tried to find my own insights. I went with the Fragile Families and Wellbeing study for my dataset.
