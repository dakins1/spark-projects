For each question, I have filtered out any reports that have a quality flag.

### 1) What station has reported the largest temperature difference in one day? What, when, and where was it?
    
    Fairbanks, Alaska, February 13th, difference of 49.5 degrees C

    This seems a little extreme. The minimum temperature for this day was -37.8, and the max was 11.7.
    
    Considering this is Alaska, it's likely a snowstorm caused the -37.8, but disappated quickly enough to allow the 11.7 later on in the day. 

### 2) What location has the largest temperature difference over the entire year of 2017?

    Ust-Nera, Russia, difference of 89.2 degrees C.
    
     According to Wikipedia, this is considered one of the coldest permanently inhabited regions on Earth.

    The lowest temperature it recorded in 2017 was -55.7 C, and the highest 33.5 C. This is relatively normal for a subartic climate.  


### 3) Standard deviation for all US max and min temperatures?

     StdDev max: 11.781782062650546 
     StdDev min: 10.540712668387611
